# Common Crews

## Swarm

### PMT - Pike/Moreau/T'Lann

### SNW - Pike/Spock/(Una/La'an)

### Greed - Jaylah/Five/(T'Laan/SNW Spock)

## Hostile

### PMC - Pike/Moreau/Chen (Battleship/Explorer)

### PMT - Pike/Moreau/Chen (Interceptor)

### Picard/Beverly/(Worf/triangle) (51+)

## Capital System Traders

### Heavy Traders - Beverly/TOS-Mudd/Khan

The idea here is that Beverly will provide damage mitigation while Khan is steadily increasing critical hit chance.  When Beverly's shield recharging can no longer keep up with the damage, Mudd's damage multiplier will kick in.  By this time a reasonably-leveled Khan will be providing near-constant critical hits, which are now at least doubled in damage.

You'll want at least an Epic G3 ship to win against these ships, and it'll probably be around tier 4 or 5 that it becomes reasonable to expect success -- though it might cost you one hull per ship.

### Normal Traders - PMC

If you can't take on these ships with just PMC, try using Cerritos to boost the ship.  Once you can get to where the damage is minimal to your hull, you can start to grind these ships like any other survey.

## Mission Hostiles (Yellow)

### Five/Seven/(triangle)

Five will provide significant mitigation, especially when paired with another Borg officer.  That mitigation is based on the Health stat, so pairing with Seven will boost the Health stats of all officers at least 75%.  The remaining slot is taken by a triangle officer.

If you don't have a high enough cumulative stat for the triangle officer, you can swap out Seven for Eight or Nine as needed and include Hemmer below decks to raise Health that way.
