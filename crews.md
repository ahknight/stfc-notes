# Hostile Grinding

## Early - Cadet Uhura/McCoy/Spock

## Power Amplifier Duos

### Shakedown Crew - Pike/Moreau

### Next Gen Crew - Picard/Beverly

## Mitigation Officers

### Energy weapons - Chen (vs Battleship/Explorer)

### Kinetic weapons - T'Lann (vs Interceptor)

### Worf

Worf is good in this combo when you are fighting along your natural triangle benefit.  Every ship has a single naturally-high mitigation stat and Worf will raise it by at least 40%.  When you don't know what you're going after, this is a good choice.  Note that Picard's ability (and synergy with that ability) will raise this at least to 90%.

### Marcus

Use Marcus when you are going after explorers, as he raises your ship's shield piercing by a fixed amount based on your crew's Defense stat.

### Charvanek

Use Charvanek against battleships as she raises your armor piercing stat by a fixed amount based on your crew's Health stat.

### Kang

Use Kang against interceptors as he raises your accuracy stat by a fixed amount based on your crew's Attack stat.

## Damage Officers

Just as there are officers whose job it is to mitigate damage, there are officers whose job is to magnify damage against certain hostiles.  There's a balance to be had here as using these officers with a Power Duo will leave you largely without additional mitigation, so be sure your research and below deck officers can help you out here before trying these.

### L'nar

### Yuki

### ???

## SNW Crew

### Interceptor to Battleship - Pike/Uhura/(La'an, Una, Hemmer)

### Battleship to Explorer - Pike/Ortegas/(La'an, Una, Hemmer)

### Explorer to Interceptor - Pike/Spock/(La'an, Una, Hemmer)

## Swarms

### PMT - Pike/Moreau/T'Lann

### SNW - Pike/Spock/(Una/La'an)

## Borg Probes (Vi'dar)

### Starting Out - 7/8/9

### Moving Up - PMC

### High Levels - SNW Pike/Una/Uhura

## Actian (Mantis)

### SNW Pike/Una/Ortegas

This is generally the best crew when you're looking for mitigation against the high-powered hostiles in these systems.  SNW Pike will increase the ship's shield deflection while SNW Ortegas will provide straight damage mitigation for the battleship-to-explorer encounters.  SNW Una will increase your impulse speed so you can race to the Actian Apex hostile as fast or faster than other players.

The Actian Apex hostile is an interceptor, and as such will not be mitigated by SNW Orgegas.  Also, as interceptors are kinetic damage and explorers are energy damage, should you decide to bring PMC you will be similarly unequipped for mitigation of this hostile.  The expected pattern is for players to gather all three boosts from the explorer hostiles and then go after the Apex while the buffs are active (5m each).  However, at higher tiers the Mantis is perfectly capable of hitting the Apex hostile without the buffs.

### Five/Gorkon/Kang (w/Hugh)

Once your Mantis is strong enough, this crew makes Apex sniping a breeze. Five provides general mitigation boosts as well as a big boost to hostile loot, which is exactly what we need here. Hugh below will ensure a good number of critical hits happen to trigger Gorkon and create the hull breach. Meanwhile, Kang is punching through the Apexâ€™s strongest mitigation and ensuring that the breeched crits cause maximum damage.

### Other Ships - Five/Nero/Tal

Below deck use: Ghalinar, EMH, Hugh, La'An, Odo, Mariner, Torres


## Capital System Traders

These are good ships to grind in the late 30s and early 40s due to the 4-star BPs they drop.  You can get BP for the uncommon survey (shipyard 41) and uncommon warship (shipyard 42) as drops from the traders in this system (mainly the heavy traders).

### Heavy Traders - Beverly/TOS-Mudd/Khan

The idea here is that Beverly will provide damage mitigation while Khan is steadily increasing critical hit chance.  When Beverly's shield recharging can no longer keep up with the damage, Mudd's damage multiplier will kick in.  By this time a reasonably-leveled Khan will be providing near-constant critical hits, which are now at least doubled in damage.

You'll want at least an Epic G3 ship to win against these ships, and it'll probably be around tier 4 or 5 that it becomes reasonable to expect success -- though it might cost you one hull per ship.

### Normal Traders - PMC

If you can't take on these ships with just PMC, try using Cerritos to boost the ship.  Once you can get to where the damage is minimal to your hull, you can start to grind these ships like any other survey.

# Armadas

## Regular Armadas (FKR)

### DS9

### TNG

### Five/Six/Khan

While also a Greed crew, the other traits of this crew are quite effective in armadas.  The synergy between Five and Six provides good mitigation while the ever-increasing piercing and critical hit chance of Six and Khan will steadily increase both your damage and the amount that hits the armada hull.

While Six wants you to stack Attack for this crew, you should consider stacking Health to boost Five instead for more challenging armadas, relying on Khan's critical hit chance increase to deal damage.

## Eclipse Armadas (Muddmadas)

## Swarm Armadas (Swarmadas)

## Cardassian Armadas

## Solo Armadas (Dominion)

### Defiant - Sisko/Miles/Six (stack Attack)

The Defiant was designed to excel with crew that give it multiple shots, so Miles is a must.  Sisko brings critical hits and mitigation enhanced with synergy.  Six brings penetration.  Boosted with a Cerritos and/or cloak, the Defiant will bring the damage.

### D4 - Beverly/Khan/Gorkon (stack Defense/Health)

With a ship ability that depends on hull breach, Gorkon brings out the best in the D4.  Since Gorkon depends on critical hits to activate, Khan joins the crew to bring a continual increase in critical hit chance.  Meanwhile, Beverly brings mitigation and shield regeneration to keep the ship intact.  With an ever-increasing critical hit chance boosted by a hull breach and a ship ability that raises its damage every round there's a hull breach, the D4 excels at long battles like armadas.

### Bullet Sponges - Five/Spock/Kirk (stack Health)

For non-epic ships that join the battle, they're basically bullet sponges.  Their job is be there round after round taking the hits instead of the ships doing damage.  Bring at most one.  With this crew, Five brings the mitigation with Health stacked below and Spork brings the shield regeneration.

### Additional DS9 Crewing

# Mission Hostiles (Yellow)

### Five/Seven/(triangle)

Five will provide significant mitigation, especially when paired with another Borg officer.  That mitigation is based on the Health stat, so pairing with Seven will boost the Health stats of all officers at least 75%.  The remaining slot is taken by a triangle officer.

If you don't have a high enough cumulative stat for the triangle officer, you can swap out Seven for Eight or Nine as needed and include Hemmer below decks to raise Health that way.

### Five/Khan/Lorca

Similar to the above, except for ships/players with enough mitigation this swaps for rapidly-increasing damage with the combination of a breach officer and a steady crit chance increase.

# Base Hits

## Saladin - Rom/Honorguard Worf/Harrison

For the first round, Rom delays all attacks from the station while Harrison drops their shields significantly.  HGW increases the critical hit chance for the first 8 rounds meaning that Saladin's large weapon (fires third in the first round) has a good chance of being a critical hit that will strike the first ship or weapon in defense order.

While it won't always take a base out, it will almost always allow you to make progress for every hit.

Counters: Kras with full synergy on a ship will negate Rom's ability entirely.

# Crewing for Loot

## Hostiles - Five of Eleven

## Armadas - Geordi

### Solo

#### Defiant - Five/Six/Khan

#### D4 - Geordi/Beverly/Picard

#### Franklin-A - Jaylah/Miles/Sisko

## Swarms - Jaylah

### Jaylah/Five/(T'Laan/SNW Spock)

### Jaylah/Kang/SNW Spock

# Base Defense

Due to the need to use the Jellyfish, all ships should be small explorers, like Realta and Turas. Keep them low-level so they're quick to repair.

## Pon/Weyoun/Kirk

Delays the opponent's first three rounds, sometimes.

## Kras/Lorca/Georgeau (not the smallest ship)

Negates Rom.  Hull breach.  Burning.

## Pike/Moreau/Harrison (smallest)

Brings shields down for the first round.

## Picard/Beverly/SNW Orgegas

Delays opponent several rounds.

## Yuki (full synergy)

Strips shields in an ongoing fashion.
