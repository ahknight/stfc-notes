# Xindi

## Reptilian

As these disable crits fairly effectively, using a full Archer crew for loot and then pure damage and defense below deck is the best strategy.

Go with Archer/Trip/Phlox on top and Paris/Torres/Mariner/Chapel/EMH below to start.

## Aquatic Grinding (NX)

## Aquatic Battleships (NX T4+)

Use Pike/Harrison/E-Data with Chapel and other round-one helpers below decks.  The trick is to destroy the battleship before the fifth shot in round one so that you don't get the Go Home Gun.  This way you can grind nearly forever and load up on the battleship loot.  Stick with the level 40s for this one; you don't get more loot with the higher levels anyway.

## Aquatic Trick (NX T4+)

Use Leslee/Moreau/Georgiou to attack the highest level battleship you can reach.  You'll explode, but there's a very good chance you'll do so with a full cargo bay.  That's millions instead of thousands for lower-level NXs.  You'll want to be tier 4 or higher for this trick.

# Chimera Armadas

Five/Lorca/Khan with crit crew below (Torres/Odo/Troi/etc.).  Note that these do not count as armadas, but do count as a kind of hostile that doesn't always trigger hostile abilities.  Hostile FTs will trigger as well as the Voyager crew, but the SNW crew and Hugh will not trigger.
